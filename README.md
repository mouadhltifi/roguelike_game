# roguelike_game
In this project I tested out the basics learned about programming and the C language during the course "Fondamenti di Informatica" at Politecnico di Milano.

It's not finished yet, as right now the game just generates a random map and lets the player move around to find an exit.

I will soon upload the updates which will make the player be able to move into different levels within one game. Health status and enemies will be added as well.
